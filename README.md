Project Name: HTML/CSS/JavaScript STOP WATCH

DESCRIPTION
This project is a simple stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch allows users to accurately measure the elapsed time between the start and stop events.

The user interface (UI) is designed using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing display. The stopwatch is presented with a clear and easy-to-read layout, making it simple for users to interact with.

The JavaScript functionality powers the stopwatch's behavior, enabling the accurate measurement of time. The script manages the start, stop, and reset functions, as well as updating the display in real-time.
